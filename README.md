This project is to create a herbal leaf classifier.
I have collected the dataset for around 10 classes like

and about 100 images for each classes.

Currently getting an accuracy of 68.38 % with a LeNet model
Further working to collect more & better dataset and to modify the model so as to improve efficiency.
